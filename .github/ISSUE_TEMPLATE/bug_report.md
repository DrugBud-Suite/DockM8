**Environment:**
 - OS: [e.g. Ubuntu or WSL2]

 - Python version [e.g. 3.10]

**Test Case?**

Please upload your own data if possible so we can determine if the bug is due to broken .sdf or .pdb files (see the [Attaching Files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files) tutorial).
